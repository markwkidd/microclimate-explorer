# How local is your local weather data?

## Purpose

Microclimate Explorer is a foundation in C# .NET for accessing and utilizing geographically-granular climate data.

Uses include precise data for agricultural planning and other situations where it is valuable to be able to directly access weather station data for a designated area.

This repository was created at the beginning of the development process, and the commit log will be used to document progress towards a working implementation.

## Data sources

The most important dataset for the preliminary implementation comes from citizen weather stations. This data is aggregated by the APRS-IS (Automatic Packet Reporting System-Internet Service).

Microclimate Explorer will make use of this data via the Meterological Assimilation Data Ingest System (MADIS) or the findU database of weather, position, telemetry, and message data.

Identify and describe at least 3 or more features you integrated from the provided list

## Implementation

### Technology and frameworks

- C# MAUI Blazor
- Access climate and map data via API
- SQLite database instance
- Class-based custom data structures
- Modular code using appropriately utilizing functions and methods, including return values

### Software development features

- Unit tests
- Regular expression (regex) for input validation
- Use of a dictionary or list data structure
- Write a text log file
- Code comments relecting use of SOLID principles
